  \abstract{Measurements of infants' quotidian experiences provide critical
information about early development. However, the role of sampling
methods in providing this information is rarely examined. Here we
directly compare language input from hourlong videos and daylong
audio-recordings within the same group of 44 infants, at 6 and 7 months.
We find far denser noun input in video- than in audio-recordings, across
12 measures of language quantity and lexical diversity, talker
variability, utterance-type, and referential transparency. Although
audio-recordings captured \textasciitilde{}10x more awake-time than
videos, the noun input in them was only 2-5x greater. Most notably, per
unit time, videos featured more word-types and tokens, more questions
but fewer declaratives, and more talkers. In contrast, videos often
lacked certain input altogether, e.g.~reading, singing, and fathers'
speech. While we find moderate correlations across recording-types, the
most common audio-recording nouns were far more consistent across
families than top video-recording nouns. Thus, even when standardized
per unit time, hourlong video and daylong audio-recordings provided
fairly divergent pictures of the input infants hear learn from in their
daily lives. We suggest short video-recordings may inflate various
language input estimates, and should be used cautiously for
extrapolation about common words, talkers, situations, and contexts at
larger timescales. If theories of language development are to be held
accountable to `facts on the ground' from observational data, we
advocate for greater care in unpacking the ramifications of sampling
methods of early language input.}

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Researchers have studied development by observing infants experiencing
their natural habitats for over a century (Taine, 1876, Williams
(1937)). Over the past 20-30 years, written records have been
increasingly supplemented with annotated audio and video recordings,
which have described the linguistic, social, and physical landscape in
which infants learn. Such data -- often shared through repositories like
CHILDES and Databrary -- in turn provide a proxy for various
\enquote{input} measures in theories of psycho-social, motor, and in
particular, linguistic development (MacWhinney, 2001).

Furthermore, recent technological advances have made it feasible to
collect longer, denser, and higher-quality recordings of infants'
day-to-day lives, which aim to provide better approximations of infants'
input and early language abilities (Bergelson \& Aslin, 2017; Oller et
al., 2010; B. C. Roy, Frank, DeCamp, Miller, \& Roy, 2015; VanDam et
al., 2016; Weisleder \& Fernald, 2013), inter alia. Such naturalistic
data seeks to reveal what infants actually learn from as they make use
of their biological endowments and environmental resources.

While cutting edge technologies make collecting observational data ever
easier, this growing toolbox increases researchers' decision load, with
serious but underexplored side-effects. For instance, researchers must
decide on recording modalities (e.g.~audio, video, both), where, whom,
and how long to record, and whether to capture structured or
free-ranging interactions, with or without experimenters present. While
any path through such decision-trees may lead to equivalent results,
this is rarely tested directly. Problematically, this leads to research
with theoretical conclusions built on equivalency assumptions that go
unmeasured.

In recent work directly comparing observational sampling methods,
Tamis-LeMonda, Kuchirko, Luo, Escobar, and Bornstein (2017) analyzed
mother-infant behavior in 5-minute structured interactions, and 45
minutes of free play. Home sessions were video-recorded by an
experimenter and transcribed. The results showed that relative to free
play, infants generally experienced more language both in word-quantity
(i.e.~tokens) and word-variability (i.e.~types) per minute during
structured interactions. They also found that language quantity across
contexts correlated, and that the peak five-minutes of the naturalistic
interaction was similar to the 5-minute structured interaction. They
conclude that sampling must be matched with research question and
caution that while brief samples may be appropriate for studying
individual differences, extrapolations about overall language input from
short samples must be made with care.

In contrast, work by Hart and Risley (1995) extrapolated extensively.
Based on 30 hours of data per family (collected one hour per month for
2.5 years), these researchers estimated that by age four, children
receiving public assistance (n=6) heard \textgreater{}30-million fewer
words than professional-class children (n=13). While their results
highlighting SES differences certainly merited (and received) follow-up
(e.g. (Fernald, Marchman, \& Weisleder, 2013, Noble, Norman, \& Farah,
2005), \emph{inter alia}), they have been criticized as an extreme
over-extrapolation (Dudley-Marling \& Lucas, 2009; Michaels, 2013).

Still other research analyzes base rates of certain linguistic
phenomena, to provide in-principle proof of what young children can
learn from their input (Brent \& Siskind, 2001; Lidz, Waxman, \&
Freedman, 2003; Tomasello, 2000). Here, the research question dictated
what was deemed appropriate sampling. Problematically, for most
exploratory work, \enquote{appropriate} sampling is hard to premeditate.
For instance, practically any length of adult speech, across
wide-ranging recording parameters will find function words (e.g.
\enquote{of}) at much higher rates than content words (e.g.
\enquote{fork}). But for questions concerning infants' language input,
it is largely unknown how methodological choices may bias our answers.

In the present study, we explore these issues, directly comparing
hour-long video-recordings and daylong audio-recordings in a single
sample of 44 infants, at 6 and 7 months, as part of a larger study on
early noun learning. We annotated concrete nouns (generally, objects,
foods, animals, or body-parts) said to infants, or said loudly and
clearly in their presence. We further annotated three properties
previously linked with early language learning: (1) utterance-type,
which provides syntactic and situational information (cf.(Brent \&
Siskind, 2001; DeBaryshe, 1993; Hoff \& Naigles, 2002)) (2) referential
transparency, which clarifies whether the target of the spoken word is
visually appreciable (Bergelson \& Aslin, 2017; Bergelson \& Swingley,
2013; Cartmill et al., 2013; Yurovsky, Smith, \& Yu, 2013), and (3)
talker, which lets us quantify the range of speakers infants hear
(Bergmann, Cristia, \& Dupoux, 2016; Rost \& McMurray, 2010).

This design sets up two overarching questions. First, do features of the
noun input in one video-recorded hour predict these same quantities in
an entire audio-recorded day? Second, do input quantities differ once
time is standardized? If the noun input is equivalent and predictive
across recording-types, then researchers can freely vary their
observational data collection approach with impunity. If it is not,
understanding the biases of various methods is critical to ensuring our
learning theories consider the data quantity and variability avilable to
learners day-to-day.

Thus, our main goal was to compare language input young infants receive
across four key properties (word quantity/diversity, utterance-type,
referential transparency, and talker), as measured by hourlong videos
and (separate) full-day audio-recordings. This seemingly methodological
question has deep implications for developmental theory: we examine how
sampling and aggregation approaches may alter conclusions about the
linguistic input that in turn drives early development.

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}}

Participants were recruited from an existing database of families from
local hospitals, or who heard about the BabyLab from friends, family,
and outreach. Forty-six participants enrolled; two dropped out in the
early stages of the project leaving 44 infants in the final sample. All
infants were full-term (40 ± 3 weeks), had no known vision or hearing
problems, and heard \textgreater{}75\% spoken English in the home.
Participants were 95\% white; 75\% of mothers had a B.A. or higher. The
families were enrolled in a yearlong study that included monthly audio-
and video-recordings, as well as in-lab visits every other month. Here
we report on the home recording data from the first two timepoints (6
and 7 months) of this study, for which participants were compensated
\$10; see table
\ref{tab:recording-ages-table}.\footnote{We include only these timepoints because at this stage of development no infants had begun producing words themselves (which may change the input for reasons orthogonal to those we examine here), and given the broader project aims, these timepoints alone had the entire daylong audiorecording annotated.}

\end{table}

\hypertarget{procedures}{%
\subsection{Procedures}\label{procedures}}

Participants gave consent at an initial lab visit for the larger study
through a process approved by the University of Rochester IRB.
Questionnaires about various aspects of the family's and infant's
background conducted during lab visits, not germane to the present
analysis, are reported elsewhere (Bergelson \& Aslin, 2017) \textbf{ADD
REF Laing and Bergelson, under review)}. Four recordings were collected
for each infant: an audio- and video-recording at six and at seven
months. Each recording was on a different day. See Table
\ref{tab:recording-ages-table}.

Audio-video release forms were given to parents and collected after the
audio and video recordings for the month were complete. Parents could
opt to share the data with other authorized researchers and/or to have
excerpts used for academic presentation. The released audio and video
files can be accessed by registered researchers on Databrary.

\hypertarget{video-recordings}{%
\subsection{Video-Recordings}\label{video-recordings}}

Researchers visited infants' homes each month to video-record a typical
hour of infants' lives from their own perspective. To achieve this,
infants were outfitted with a hat or headband affixed with two small,
lightweight Looxcie cameras (22g each). One camera was oriented slightly
down and the other slightly up, to capture most of the infant's visual
field (verified by Bluetooth with an iPad/iPhone during setup). A
standard camcorder (Panasonic HC-V100 or Sony HDR-CX240) on a tripod was
set up in a location that could best capture the infant. Parents were
asked to move this camera with them if they changed rooms. After set-up,
experimenters left for one hour.

\hypertarget{audio-recordings}{%
\subsection{Audio-Recordings}\label{audio-recordings}}

Audio-recordings captured a full day (up to 16 hours) of infants'
language input. Parents were given vests with a small chest-pocket, and
LENAs (LENA Foundation, Boulder, CO), small audio-recorders
(\textless{}60g) that fit into the vest pocket. Parents were asked to
put the vest and recorder on babies from when they awoke to when they
went to bed (with the exceptions of naps and baths). Parents were
permitted to pause the recorder at any time but were asked to keep such
pauses minimal.

\hypertarget{data-processing}{%
\subsection{Data Processing}\label{data-processing}}

Details of our entire data processing pipeline are on our lab wiki
(\url{https://osf.io/cxwyz/wiki/home/}). Videos were processed using
Sony Vegas and in-house video-editing scripts. Footage was aligned in a
single, multi-camera view before manual language annotation in Datavyu.
Audio recordings were initially processed by LENA proprietary software,
which segments and diarizes each audio file; this output was then
converted to CLAN format for further processing and manual annotation.
Through in-house scripts, long periods of silence were demarcated in
these CLAN files (e.g.~when the audio vest was removed or during naps).
The CLAN files were then used for manual language annotation.

\hypertarget{language-annotation}{%
\subsection{Language Annotation}\label{language-annotation}}

Recordings were annotated by trained researchers. The \enquote{sparse
annotation} entailed marking each concrete noun heard by the child. This
included words directed to or easily overheard by the child (e.g.~words
directed at a sibling next to the infant), but not distant or background
language (e.g.~background television). We operationalized
\enquote{object words} as concrete, imageable nouns (e.g.~shoe, arm).
For each object word, we included the word (as said by the speaker, e.g.
\enquote{teethies}) and lemma (i.e.~dictionary form, e.g.~tooth), along
with three properties: utterance-type, object presence, and talker.
Utterance-type classified each object word utterance as declarative,
question, imperative, reading, singing, short-phrase, or unclear.
Short-phrase utterances include words in isolation and short, simple
noun phrases (e.g. \enquote{the red ball} or \enquote{kitty's paw}).
Object-presence was a binary measure of whether the object was present
and attended to. Lastly, the word's talker was recorded, including live
interlocutors and electronics: mother, brother, toy, etc.

We assessed intercoder reliability on a random contiguous 10\% of the
annotations in each file. \textbf{add reliability analysis}

\hypertarget{analysis-plan}{%
\subsection{Analysis Plan}\label{analysis-plan}}

Based on the coding scheme above, we derived 12 count measures from each
recordings' annotations for each child (n=44), recording-type (audio,
video), and month (six, seven). See Table \ref{tab:measures-tab}. We
then averaged the data from month six and seven to increase the
precision of our input estimates, and since we have no
theoretically-motivated reason to predict input differences across this
4 week span (i.e.~there are no developmental or linguistic milestones
typically achieved at 6-7 months.) We also normalized the count measures
by recording length; further details are below. While we initial
anticipated conducting multi-level models with fixed effects of
recording-type and random subject-level effects, nearly all such models
revealed highly non-normal residuals (by visual inspection and Shapiro
Test), limiting interpretation across measures, even when
log-transformed. Thus, we instead report a simple set of nonparametric
analyses below.

For all recording-type comparisons, we look at whether our measures
\emph{differed} significantly (by two-tailed, paired Wilcoxon Test), and
\emph{correlated} significantly (by Kendall Rank Correlation) across the
given groups. This approach lets us compare, e.g., whether the
proportion of declaratives is indistinguishable in our audio and video
recordings independently of whether these values are correlated across
recording-types. We applied Holm's p-value adjustment for multiple
comparisons (\textbf{ADD REF:}Holm, 1979), for the set of 12 Wilcoxon
tests, and the set of 12 Kendall Correlations.

\hypertarget{count-measures-audio--vs.video-recordings}{%
\subsection{Count Measures, Audio-
vs.~Video-recordings}\label{count-measures-audio--vs.video-recordings}}

Before assessing how our 12 measures of noun input scaled between
hour-long video-recordings and daylong audio-recordings, we analyzed
recording lengths. Modally, videos were an hour (62 min, \emph{M}=60.79
min, SD=6.31, R=27.9-74.9 min), and audio-recordings were 16 hours (960
min, \emph{M}=858.41 min, SD=119.41, R=635-960 min), the maximum
capacity of the LENA device. While audio-recordings began when children
awoke, we further estimated the onsets and offsets of daytime naps by
removing the \enquote{silent} portions of the recordings (see Methods).
This provided an estimated upper-limit on infants' awake
(i.e.~non-silent) time (Mode = 654 min., \emph{M} = 603min, SD=106.8,
R=385.2-951 min ). Our estimates comported with established norms for
6--8-month-olds in the US (\textbf{ADD REF:} Mandel et al, 2010), which
are 180 minutes of daytime sleep, and 600 minutes of nighttime sleep.
Infants were always awake during video recordings (save one infant, who
fell asleep before the recording-hour ended; that video was stopped at
sleep onset).

To examine how the hour-long video data \enquote{scale} to day-length
data descriptively, we first divided the 12 count metrics from the
videos by those from the audio-recordings for each child, to derive
\enquote{video-fraction} scores. This showed that the video-recordings
were \textasciitilde{}0.07 of the length of audio-recordings, or 0.10 of
the length if only \enquote{non-silent} portions of the audio-recording
are included. However, rather than a concomitant 10-fold decrease in our
count metrics (as would be expected if the video captured a
\enquote{representative} hour of the day), the fractions averaged to
across measures; see Table @ref(tab:vboost\_table) \textbf{FIX INF
VALUES}. Thus, by and large, videos had a denser concentration of nouns
across our measures than did the audio recordings.

We computed video-fractions (rather than the reciprocal,
i.e.~audio/video) because there were more zero values for videos than
audio-recordings (e.g.~instances when children did not hear any nouns
sung), rendering more undefined values. Indeed, \textgreater{}1/3 of
children did not hear nouns in reading or from fathers on videos in
either month. See Table \ref{tab:propna-missing-tables}.

We next normed our count values by the number of minutes in each. For
example, if an infant heard 500 noun-tokens in 800 minutes of non-silent
audio-recording, and 200 in 60 minutes of videos, this was normed to .62
and 3.3 noun-tokens per minute, respectively. Zero values are retained
within the normed count data.\textbackslash{}footnote\{One infant's zero
value was excluded from \enquote{father} measures (as in
\ref{tab:propna-missing-tables}); this infant had no father.

With the normed data, 11/12 of our metrics occurred at significantly
lower rates in audio recordings than video recordings
(adjusted-p\textless{}.05). The remaining metric, number of nouns from
fathers, was statistically indistinguishable across recording types
(adjusted-p\textgreater{}.05). Thus, overall, per unit time, infants
heard less noun input across our metrics of quantity, talker,
utterance-type and object presence in audio recordings than in videos.

Looking next at correlations, we find that 10/12 metrics correlated in
audio vs.~video data; nouns per minute heard from fathers and in singing
did not. The size of the correlations was moderate (excluding the two
non-significant metrics, \emph{M} = 0.44, 0.27 - 0.57, all
adjusted-p\textless{}.05). See Table \ref{tab:normtable} and Figures

exploratory analyses at the word level, which aim to provide a
first-pass characterization of whether audio and video recordings
captured the same nouns and the same relative frequencies across words
and families. The distribution of nouns in our recordings was zipfian:
of the 5801unique object words (3137 lemmas) heard across months and
recording types, only 2482 (960 lemmas) were heard more than once (see
Figures \ref{fig:zipfian} and \ref{fig:top-100-logspace}).

\end{figure}

We examined the top 100 most frequent nouns from audio- and
video-recordings (n=136 due to ties, n=68 without words that occurred
zero times in one recording-type). Frequency across recording-types
correlated significantly (Kendall's tau: 0.39, p\textless{}.0001,) even
with zero-frequency words included (Kendall's tau: 0.25,
p\textless{}.0001; see Figure \ref{fig:top100-corr-rectype}).

\caption{\label{fig:top100-corr-rectype}Top 100 words correlations by

\end{figure}

Finally, looking at just the top ten words by recording-type, we find
that the top audio words were far more common across families than the
top video words were (see Figure \ref{fig:top10noun-freq}). While four
of the top 10 words overlapped (baby, book, mouth, toes), the top audio
words were roughly three times as frequent as the top video words, again
reflecting the higher density of video-recordings (which were 1/10 the
length of audio recordings on average). Taken together, this exploratory
analysis suggests that daylong audio-recordings appear to render more
stable high-frequency words across families than do video-recordings.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

Our results can be distilled to three key findings. First, infants heard
relatively more nouns in the video recordings than in the audio
recordings. Per minute, infants heard \textasciitilde{}2-5x more noun
input across our quantity, speaker, utterance-type, and object-presence
metrics when they and their caretakers were video-recorded for an hour
versus audio-recorded for a day. Second, while our metrics correlated
across audio- and video-recordings, the relative rates of the most
prevalent utterance types, and the quantity of unattested data varied
across them. Finally, while the highest frequency words across recording
types largely overlapped and correlated (and exhibited Zipfian frequency
distributions), top words from the daylong audio-recording appear to
better represent the noun input across families.

Our comparison across recording-types highlighted many differences
across our noun input measures, even with family and age held constant.
Our quantity results also conceptually replicate and extend those of
Tamis-Lemonda et al (2017). Despite numerous methodological differences
(recording lengths, experimenter presence, infant age, word class
analyzed), both studies find that parent talk per unit time is
significantly higher in shorter recordings. While the difference they
find is less extreme numerical (roughly 1.5-2x the number of types and
tokens in the longer vs.~shorter recording compared to our 2-3-fold
difference), this general pattern appears robust across our very
different sampling methods. Taken together, these results converge in
suggesting that shorter recordings elicit denser caregiver talk.

We find consistently more object co-presence in video- than in
audio-recordings. This may be because the video recordings truly had
more object presence (i.e.~infants mostly stayed in 1-2 rooms,
interacting with caregivers and objects at hand). Alternatively, or
additionally, it may be the case that there are more ambiguous cases of
\enquote{object co-presence} in audio recordings than video recordings,
which were in turn annotated as \enquote{not present} at higher rates.
Given the XX rates of agreement, we find it more likely that this
reflects a true difference between situations that arise during daylong
audio vs.~hourlong video recordings. Insofar as object presence is
linked with early word learning (Bergelson \& Aslin, 2017), a more
extensive understanding of what modulates it is an important issue left
to future work.

We did not anticipate that the top utterance-types would vary by
recording-type. That is, while questions and declaratives made up the
majority of the input for each recording-type at each month, videos had
relatively more questions and fewer declaratives. This is key example of
methodological choices potentially influencing language acquisition
theories: base rates of interrogatives taken from videos would inflate
estimates of auxiliary verbs in the early input. Indeed, previous work
has noted that published studies vary in whether they find links between
questions (yes/no and wh-) in the input, and children's early
productions, with developmental level of the child invoked to explain
differences across studies (Barnes et al, 1983; see discussion in
Huttenlocher et al, 2002). Here we add the possibility that
recording-type too may contribute to the base-rates of questions in the
input, even with age kept constant.

\hypertarget{top-words}{%
\subsection{Top Words}\label{top-words}}

The pattern across recording-types suggests to us that parents behaved
naturally during recordings, but that \enquote{natural} behavior
differed by recording context. This is consistent with a point made by
Suskind et al (2013) regarding an intervention: \enquote{sustaining
increased talk for a 10-hr recording day is much less likely than being
on best behavior during {[}a{]} 1-hr videotaped session\ldots{}} While
their work aimed to encourage caretakers to talk more, the point stands
for our goals of observing infants' typical input. We add to their
suggestion that shorter video-recording itself may elicit certain kinds
of interactions, separate from deliberate intent or lack thereof on
caretakers' part.

Indeed, the kinds of everyday interactions we captured in daylong audio
recordings (family members rushing to get out the door or get meals on
the table, sibling quibbles, etc.) tended to \enquote{feel} more
natural. Families likely simply found it easier to go about their day
freely with infants in a special vest than with a camera on their head,
and a camcorder in the corner. Lending some support that equipment
prominence matters, both \enquote{hat} and \enquote{camera} are in the
top 10 words from video-recordings each month; no analogous nouns
(e.g.~vest, recorder) topped the frequency rankings in our audio
recordings (see Figure XX).

Our interpretation of the present results is that findings based on
relatively short video-recordings overestimate young infants' typical
noun input, and that extrapolation based on daylong audio recordings
likely better represents infants' quotidian experiences. This
underscores our third main result: that the conclusions one would draw
about which words are most common in young infants' language input
differed in their robustness across families by recording type. That is,
the top audio words were all heard by \(\geq 75\%\) of the families we
recorded; only one of the top 10 video words (\enquote{hat}) was this
common across families. This is true even though the video words had
greater quantities of nouns per unit time; the top audio words only
occurred 2-4 times more often than the top video words (despite a
10-fold increase in awake recording time).

\hypertarget{limitations}{%
\subsection{Limitations}\label{limitations}}

Given the technical limitation that available infant-friendly
video-recorders have a shorter battery life than audio-recorders at
present, we cannot conclusively separate the effects of modality and
length. That is, had we only audio-recorded for an hour, or recorded
video all day, we may have obtained equivalent results across recording
modalities. Such a comparison awaits technological progress.

A further limitation is the likely influence of self-selection into the
study: many parents are unwilling to invite researchers to record their
infants' interactions. Relatedly, our convenience sample does not
reflect the broader demographics of the US (let alone other cultures or
populations), and as such this work merits extension to other
populations before conclusive generalizations about sampling methodology
can be made (cf Bergelson et al, under review).

\hypertarget{conclusions}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

Understanding what infants learn from is a key part in understanding
what and how they learn at all. Here we have taken first steps in
understanding how two different data collection approaches may influence
our conclusions about early linguistic input. We find that even
naturalistic observer-free video-recordings appear to inflate language
input. Without knowing how our sampling methods may be limiting us in
principle, we necessarily limit our ability to adequately model infant
learning. We\ldots{}
