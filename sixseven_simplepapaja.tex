  \abstract{Measurements of infants' quotidian experiences provide critical
information about early development. However, the role of sampling
methods in providing these measurements is rarely examined. Here we
directly compare language input from hour-long video-recordings and
daylong audio-recordings within the same group of 44 infants at 6 and 7
months. We compared 12 measures of language quantity and lexical
diversity, talker variability, utterance-type, and object presence,
finding moderate correlations across recording-types. However,
video-recordings generally featured far denser noun input across these
measures compared to the daylong audio-recordings, more akin to `peak'
audio hours (though not as high in talkers and word-types). Although
audio-recordings captured \textasciitilde{}10 times more awake-time than
videos, the noun input in them was only 2--4 times greater. Notably,
whether we compared videos to daylong audio-recordings or peak audio
times, videos featured relatively fewer declaratives and more questions;
furthermore, the most common video-recorded nouns were less consistent
across families than the top audio-recording nouns were. Thus, hour-long
videos and daylong audio-recordings revealed fairly divergent pictures
of the language infants hear and learn from in their daily lives. We
suggest short video-recordings provide a `dense and somewhat different'
sample of infants' language experiences, rather than a `typical' one,
and should be used cautiously for extrapolation about common words,
talkers, utterance-types, and contexts at larger timescales. If theories
of language development are to be held accountable to `facts on the
ground' from observational data, greater care is needed to unpack the
ramifications of sampling methods of early language input.}

\section{Highlights}\label{highlights}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We measured 44 infants' early noun input during free-form interactions
  in hour-long videos and daylong audio-recordings; sampling approach
  shifted potential conclusions about home language environment.
\item
  Across quantity, utterance-type, object presence, and talker measures,
  nouns-per-minute were 2--4 times more frequent in video- than
  audio-recordings; video hours largely mirrored peak audio hours.
\item
  Nouns in videos occurred relatively more often in questions and less
  often in declaratives than they did in daylong or peak audio-recording
  hours
\item
  The most frequent nouns in daylong and peak audio-recording hours
  highly overlapped in identity and across families; this was less true
  for top video nouns.
\end{itemize}

Researchers have studied development by observing infants in their
natural habitats for decades (Taine, 1876; Williams, 1937). Over the
past 20--30 years, written records have been increasingly supplemented
with audio- and video-recordings, depicting infants' linguistic, social,
and physical landscape. Such data --- often shared through repositories
like CHILDES and Databrary --- in turn provide a proxy for various
\enquote{input} measures in theories of social, motor, and particularly,
\emph{linguistic} development (MacWhinney, 2001).

Furthermore, recent technological advances allow the collection of
longer, denser, and higher-quality recordings, used to study infants'
input and language skills (Bergelson \& Aslin, 2017; Oller et al., 2010;
B. C. Roy, Frank, DeCamp, Miller, \& Roy, 2015; VanDam et al., 2016;
Weisleder \& Fernald, 2013, \emph{inter alia}). Such naturalistic data
seeks to reveal what infants actually learn from as they make use of
their biological endowments and environmental resources.

While improving technology makes collecting observational data ever
easier, more alternatives create more decision-points, with serious but
underexplored side-effects. Researchers must decide on recording
modalities (e.g.~audio, video, both), where, whom, and how long to
record, and whether to capture structured or free-ranging interactions,
with or without experimenters present. While any path through such
decision-trees may lead to equivalent results, this is rarely tested.
Problematically, this leads to research with \emph{theoretical}
conclusions built on unmeasured \emph{methodological} equivalence
assumptions.

In recent work directly comparing sampling methods, Tamis-LeMonda,
Kuchirko, Luo, Escobar, and Bornstein (2017) analyzed mother-infant
behavior in 5-minute structured interactions and 45 minutes of free play
at home. They found while language quantity across contexts correlated,
relative to free play, infants experienced more words per minute (both
types and tokens) in structured interactions. They conclude that
sampling must be matched with research question, cautioning that while
brief samples may be appropriate for studying individual differences,
extrapolations from short samples must be made with care.

In contrast, work by Hart and Risley (1995) extrapolated extensively.
Based on 30 hours of data per family (collected one hour per month for
2.5 years), these researchers estimated that by age four, children
receiving public assistance (n=6) heard \textgreater{}30 million fewer
words than professional-class children (n=13). While their findings
highlighting SES differences certainly merited (and received) follow-up
(e.g. Fernald, Marchman, \& Weisleder, 2013; Noble, Norman, \& Farah,
2005, \emph{inter alia}), the results have also been criticized as an
extreme over-extrapolation (Dudley-Marling \& Lucas, 2009; Michaels,
2013).

Still other research analyzes base rates of certain linguistic phenomena
to provide data reflecting what young children hear (Brent \& Siskind,
2001; Lidz, Waxman, \& Freedman, 2003; Tomasello, 2000). Unfortunately,
it is difficult to predetermine an \enquote{appropriate} sample for such
base rates. For instance, practically any length of adult speech, across
wide-ranging recording parameters, will find function words (e.g.
\enquote{of}) at much higher rates than content words (e.g.
\enquote{fork}). For questions concerning many aspects of infants'
language input, however, it is largely unknown how sampling may bias
results, and thus various practical constraints on data collection and
availability often guide sampling decisions.

Here we explore sampling directly, comparing hour-long video-recordings
and daylong audio-recordings in a single sample of 44 infants, as part
of a larger study on early noun learning. We annotated concrete nouns
said to (or loudly and clearly near) infants. We further annotated three
properties previously linked with early language learning: (1)
utterance-type, which provides syntactic/situational information (Brent
\& Siskind, 2001; DeBaryshe, 1993; Hoff \& Naigles, 2002) (2) object
presence (i.e.~referential transparency), which clarifies whether spoken
words' referents are visually appreciable (Bergelson \& Aslin, 2017;
Bergelson \& Swingley, 2013; Cartmill et al., 2013; Yurovsky, Smith, \&
Yu, 2013), and (3) talker, which measures speaker quantity and
prevalence (Bergmann, Cristia, \& Dupoux, 2016; Rost \& McMurray, 2010).

This design sets up two overarching questions. First, does noun input in
one video-recorded hour predict noun input in an entire audio-recorded
day? Second, do input quantities differ once time is normalized? If the
noun input is equivalent and predictive across recording-types, then
researchers can freely vary observational data collection approaches
with impunity. If not, understanding methodological biases is critical
to ensuring that learning theories consider the data quantity and
variability typically available to learners.

Below we compare language input across four key properties (word
quantity/diversity, utterance-type, object presence, and talker), as
measured by hour-long videos and (separate) full-day audio-recordings.
This seemingly methodological research has deep implications for
developmental theory: we examine how sampling may alter conclusions
about the linguistic input driving early development.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}

Infants were recruited from a database of families from local hospitals,
or through BabyLab outreach. Forty-six participants enrolled; two
dropped out leaving 44 in the final sample. All were full-term (40±3
weeks), had no known vision or hearing problems, and heard \(\geq 75\%\)
spoken English. Participants were 95\% white; 75\% of mothers had
\(\geq\)B.A. The families were enrolled in a yearlong study that
included monthly audio- and video-recordings, as well as in-lab visits
every other month. See Table \ref{tab:recording-ages-table} for age
details. Here we report on the home recording data from the first two
timepoints (6 and 7 months) of this study, for which participants
received
\$10.\footnote{We include only these timepoints because infants had not yet begun producing words themselves (which changes the input). Given the broader project aims, these timepoints alone had the entire daylong audio-recording annotated.}

\subsection{Procedures}\label{procedures}

Participants gave consent at an initial lab visit for the larger study
through a process approved by university IRB. Questionnaires concerning
family/infant background, not germane to the present analysis, are
reported elsewhere (Bergelson \& Aslin, 2017; Laing \& Bergelson, under
review). Four recordings are analyzed for each infant: an audio- and
video-recording at 6 and at 7 months, each on a different
day\footnote{A video is missing for one infant due to technical error.}.
See Table \ref{tab:recording-ages-table}. Parents who signed release
forms allowing their recordings to be shared with other researchers are
available via Databrary.

\subsection{Video-Recordings}\label{video-recordings}

Researchers visited infants' homes each month to video-record an
(ostensibly) typical hour of infants' lives. Infants were outfitted with
a hat or headband affixed with two small Looxcie cameras (22g each). One
camera was oriented slightly down and the other slightly up, to best
capture infant's visual field (verified via Bluetooth with an
iPad/iPhone during setup). A standard camcorder (Panasonic HC-V100 or
Sony HDR-CX240) was positioned in the corner on a lightweight tripod
which parents were asked to move if they changed rooms. After set-up,
experimenters left for one hour.

\subsection{Audio-Recordings}\label{audio-recordings}

Audio-recordings captured up to 16 hours of infants' input. Parents were
given LENAs (LENA Foundation, Boulder, CO), small audio-recorders
(\textless{}60g) along with infant vests with a LENA-sized chest pocket.
Parents were asked to put the vest and recorder on babies from when they
awoke to when they went to bed (excepting naps and baths). Parents were
permitted to pause the recorder anytime but were asked to minimize such
pauses.

\subsection{Data Processing}\label{data-processing}

Details of the entire data-processing pipeline are on OSF
(\url{https://osf.io/cxwyz/wiki/home/}). Videos were processed using
Vegas and in-house video-editing scripts. Footage was aligned in a
single, multi-camera view before manual language annotation in Datavyu.
Audio-recordings were initially processed by LENA proprietary software,
which segments and diarizes each audio file; this output was then
converted to CLAN format (MacWhinney \& Wagner, 2010). Through in-house
scripts, long periods of silence were marked in these CLAN files
(e.g.~naptime), which were then used for manual language annotation.

Modally, videos were an hour (62min., \emph{M}=60.79min., SD=6.31,
R=27.9--74.9min.), and audio-recordings were 16 hours (960min.,
\emph{M}=858.41min., SD=119.41, R=635--960min.), the maximum capacity of
the LENA. Removing the long silences from audio-recording left
\textasciitilde{}10hrs. of audio (Mode=654min., \emph{M}=603min.,
SD=106.8, R=385.2--951min.). Approximately 10 hours of awake-time during
the day is inline with established norms for 6--8-month-olds in the U.S.
(Mindell, Sadeh, Wiegand, How, \& Goh, 2010). All infants were awake for
the entire video-recording except one, whose video annotation ended at
sleep onset.

\subsection{Language Annotation}\label{language-annotation}

Trained researchers annotated each recording. This entailed demarcating
each concrete noun directed to or easily overheard by the child
(e.g.~words directed at adjacent siblings), but not distant language
(e.g.~background television).\enquote{Object words} were operationalized
as concrete, imageable nouns (e.g.~shoe, arm). Each annotation noted the
word and lemma (e.g.~teethies, tooth), along with \emph{utterance-type},
\emph{object presence}, and \emph{talker}. For \emph{utterance-type},
each object word's utterance was classified as declarative, question,
imperative, reading, singing, short-phrase, or unclear. (Short-phrase
utterances included words in isolation and \textless{}3 word
noun-phrases, e.g. \enquote{the red ball} or \enquote{kitty's paw}.)
\emph{Object-presence} coded whether objects were present and attended
to (yes/no) based on linguistic context (e.g. \enquote{here's your
spoon!} was scored \enquote{yes} for object presence); for videos visual
context was also used. Lastly, \emph{talker} tagged live interlocutors
and electronics: mother, toy, etc.; this was checked by staff highly
familiar with each family. We assessed intercoder reliability on a
random contiguous 10\% of the annotations in each file for the two
categorical variables (utterance-type and object-presence). Reliability
was moderate to strong (utterance-type: 87\% agreement, Cohen's
\(\kappa\)=0.81; object-presence: 83\% agreement, Cohen's
\(\kappa\)=0.65).

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Analysis Plan}\label{analysis-plan}

Based on the coding scheme above, we derived 12 measures from each
recordings' annotations for each child (n=44), recording-type (audio,
video), and month (6, 7). See Table \ref{tab:measures-tab}. We averaged
across months to increase precision, and because we have no
theoretically-motivated reason to predict input differences across
months (i.e.~no developmental or linguistic milestones are typically
achieved at 6--7 months.) While we initially anticipated analyzing the
data with multi-level models, nearly all such models revealed highly
skewed residuals (by Shapiro-Wilk Test), even when log-transformed,
limiting interpretation across measures. Thus, we instead report a
simple set of nonparametric analyses below. We used R for all analyses;
the code that rendered this manuscript is on Github, to be shared upon
publication.\footnote{Please contact corresponding author for access before publication.}

For all recording-type comparisons, we look at whether our measures
\emph{differed} significantly (by two-tailed, paired Wilcoxon Test) and
\emph{correlated} significantly (by Kendall Rank Correlation) across the
given groups. This approach lets us compare, e.g., whether the
time-normalized count of declarative nouns is indistinguishable in our
audio- and video-recordings, independently of whether these values are
correlated. We applied Holm's \emph{p}-value adjustment for multiple
comparisons (Holm, 1979) for the set of 12 Wilcoxon tests and the set of
12 Kendall Correlations.

\subsection{Count Measure Analysis}\label{count-measure-analysis}

To examine how the hour-long video data \enquote{scale} to day-length
data descriptively, we first divided the 12 count measures from the
videos by those from the audio-recordings for each child, to derive
\enquote{video-fraction} scores (video/audio). This showed that the
video-recordings were 0.07 of the length of audio-recordings, or 0.10 of
the length when audio-recording silences were removed. However, rather
than a concomitant 10-fold decrease in our count measures (as would be
expected if videos captured a \enquote{representative} hour of the day),
the fractions averaged to 0.31; see Table \ref{tab:normtable}. Thus, by
and large, videos had a denser concentration of nouns across measures
than did the audio-recordings. See Figure
\ref{fig:gr-derived-counts-67-diff} for raw count data for each measure.

We computed video-fractions (rather than the reciprocal,
i.e.~audio/video) because there were more zero values for videos than
audio-recordings (e.g.~children who heard no sung nouns), rendering more
undefined values. Indeed, \textgreater{}1/3 of children did not hear
nouns in reading or from fathers on videos in either month. See Table
\ref{tab:propna-missing-tables}.

We next normed our counts by the number of minutes in each recording.
E.g., if an infant heard 500 noun-tokens in 800 minutes of non-silent
audio-recording, and 200 in 60 minutes of video, this was normed to .62
and 3.3 noun-tokens per minute, respectively; zero values were retained
within normed
counts.\footnote{One infant's data was excluded from 'father' measures; this infant had no father at home.}

We first looked at correlations across recording types, and find that
10/12 metrics correlated in audio vs.~video data; nouns per minute heard
from fathers and in singing did not. The size of the correlations
(i.e.~Kendall's \(\tau\)) was moderate (excluding the two
non-significant metrics, \emph{M}=0.44, 0.27-0.57, all
adjusted-\emph{p}\textless{}.05). See Table \ref{tab:normtable} and
Figure \ref{fig:gr-derived-normcounts-corr}.

We next compared the rates of each measure in three ways. First, we used
the normed data, looking at counts per minute. With the normed data,
11/12 metrics occurred at significantly lower rates in audio-recordings
than video-recordings (all adjusted-\emph{p}\textless{}.05). The
remaining metric, nouns from fathers, was statistically
indistinguishable across recording types
(adjusted-\emph{p}\textgreater{}.05). Thus, overall, per unit time,
infants heard less noun input across our metrics of quantity, talker,
utterance-type and object presence in audio-recordings than in videos
(see Figure \ref{fig:gr-derived-counts-67-diff} and
\ref{fig:gr-derived-normcounts-diff} for raw and normed count data).

Next, we compared two different hour-long subsets from the daylong audio
recording for comparison with the video-recorded hour, collectively
referred to as \enquote{peak} audio times. The \emph{top} hour was
calculated by sliding a window through the annotations to find the hour
in which infants heard the most nouns. Complementarily, under the logic
that parents scheduled the video-recordings for times of high infant
altertness, we extracted that \emph{same} hour in the daylong audio,
i.e.~if the video recording visit was scheduled from 2-3pm, we used
2-3pm from that child's daylong audio recording that month. Our 12
measures were then computed in both the \emph{top} and
\emph{same-as-video} hours of audio. Top and same-as-video hours only
overlapped in 15/88 recordings
(17\%))\footnote{In 3 cases, the video-recording time (i.e. 'same-as-video' time) preceded the beginning of the daylong audio-recording (by 5, 30, or 90 minutes); in those cases the first hour of the recording was used. This created two further cases of \'top' and 'same-as-video' overlap.}

For the peak audio, 4/12 metrics occurred at significantly \emph{higher}
rates in \enquote{same} audio hour than in video-recordings (all
adjusted-\emph{p}\textless{}.05), namely the number of types, nouns from
fathers, and nouns from declaratives. Similarly, 7 occurred at
significantly higher rates in \enquote{top} audio hour than in
video-recordings (all adjusted-\emph{p}\textless{}.05); these included
all the measures that were higher in the \enquote{same} audio hour,
along with number of tokens, and nouns in imperatives and short phrases.
Thus, the video data presented a somewhat different language input
profile than the peak audio hours of the day: they featured less input
for some of our quantity, talker, and utterance-type measures, but were
statistically indistinguishable in object presence, input from mothers,
and input in other utterance-types. This same qualitative pattern held
when looking at \enquote{zero} values for the peak audio hours, relative
to the videos and daylong audio-recordings (see Table
\ref{tab:propna-missing-tables}).

\subsection{Exploratory Analyses}\label{exploratory-analyses}

Lastly, we undertook two sets of highly exploratory analyses, at the
utterance and word level. The utterance-type analysis is based on the
unanticipated result that while declaratives and questions made up
\textgreater{}2/3 of the input for each recording-type, the videos
appeared to contain relatively more questions and fewer declaratives
(See Fig. \ref{fig:gr-derived-counts-67-diff} and
\ref{fig:gr-derived-normcounts-diff}). To test this statistically, we
converted the six utterance-type counts to proportions (e.g.~number of
nouns heard in declaratives over total noun tokens), and compared the
proportion of each utterance types in video- and audio-recordings.
Wilcoxon tests of each utterance-type in audio- vs.~video-recording
(corrected for multiple comparisons) revealed that indeed, declaratives
and questions occurred at different rates across recording-types, with
audio-recordings containing relatively fewer questions
(\(M_{video}\)=0.26, \(M_{audio}\)=0.19, \(M_{same\  audio}\)=0.21,
\(M_{top\  audio}\)=0.17) and more declaratives than videos
(\(M_{video}\)=0.40, \(M_{audio}\)=0.50, \(M_{same\  audio}\)=0.49,
\(M_{top\ audio}\)=0.47; each video vs.~audio comparison
adjusted-\emph{p}\textless{}.05). No other proportional utterance-type
differences reached significance across recording-types (all
adjusted-\emph{p}\textgreater{}.05). See Figure
\ref{fig:gr-ut-count-collapsed}.

At the word level, we aimed to characterize whether audio- and
video-recordings captured the same nouns and the same relative
frequencies across words and families. Nouns' frequency distribution was
Zipfian: of the 5801 unique object words (3137 lemmas) heard across
months and recording-types, only 2482 (960 lemmas) occurred more than
once.

We examined the 100 most frequent nouns from audio- and video-recordings
(n=136 due to ties, n=68 without words that occurred zero times in one
recording-type). Frequency across recording-types correlated
significantly (Kendall's tau: 0.39, \emph{p}\textless{}.0001) even with
zero-frequency words included (Kendall's tau: 0.25,
\emph{p}\textless{}.0001; see Figure \ref{fig:top-100-logspace} and
\ref{fig:top100-corr-rectype} ).

Finally, we analyzed the top ten words by recording-type. Four of the
top ten words in each recording-type overlapped (baby, book, mouth,
toes), suggesting that extremely common words are relatively conserved
across recording-types. However, the top audio words were far more
common across families (see Figure \ref{fig:top10noun-freq}). Indeed,
the ten most frequent nouns in audio-recordings were heard by 37-44
(\emph{M}=42.30(2.63)) of the 44 families; those in video-recordings
were heard by 23-42 (\emph{M}=31(6.27)). Finally, the top audio words
were \textasciitilde{}3x as common as the top video words
(\(M_{audio}\)=761.80(114.75), \(M_{video}\)=232.80(91.38)), again
underscoring the higher density of nouns in video-recordings (which were
\textasciitilde{}1/10 the length of audio-recordings). Taken together,
this exploratory analysis suggests that daylong audio-recordings may
render more stable estimates of pervasively common words across families
than do video-recordings.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

Our results can be distilled to three key findings. First, infants heard
relatively more nouns in videos than in the audio-recordings. Per
minute, infants heard \textasciitilde{}2--4x more noun input across
quantity, speaker, utterance-type, and object-presence metrics when
video-recorded for an hour versus audio-recorded for a day. Second,
while our metrics generally correlated across audio- and
video-recordings, the relative rates of the most prevalent
utterance-types and the rates of unattested data for certain metrics
varied across them. Finally, while the highest frequency words across
recording types largely overlapped and correlated, top words from the
daylong audio-recording appear to better represent the noun input across
families.

\subsection{Noun Quantity and Lexical
Diversity}\label{noun-quantity-and-lexical-diversity}

Overall, the pattern across recording-types primarily suggests a
difference in volubility, since by-and-large measures both correlated
and differed across recording-type. As Suskind et al.(2013) noted about
an intervention, daylong audio recordings likely provide more realistic
counterparts to \enquote{best behavior} hourlong video-sessions. We add
that shorter video-recording itself may elicit higher speech-volume,
separate from caretakers' deliberate intent.

Indeed, families likely found it simply easier to behave freely with
infants in special vests than with cameras on their heads.
\emph{Apropos} equipment prominence, both \enquote{hat} and
\enquote{camera} were top-10 video words; no analogous nouns (e.g.~vest,
recorder) topped the frequency rankings in audio-recordings (see Figures
\ref{fig:top-100-logspace} and \ref{fig:top10noun-freq}).

Our comparison across recording-types highlighted many differences
across measures, even with family and age held constant. The quantity
metrics provide a conceptual replication and extension of Tamis-LeMonda
et al. (2017). Despite numerous methodological differences (length/type
of recordings compared, experimenter presence, age, word-class
analyzed), both studies found that parent talk per unit time was
significantly higher in shorter recordings. While the difference they
find is less extreme numerically (roughly 1.5--2x the number of types
and tokens in the longer vs.~shorter recording compared to our 2--3x
difference), this general pattern appears robust across our sampling
methods. Taken together, this suggests that shorter recordings elicit
denser caregiver talk.

For certain research questions, these differences in volubility and
lexical diversity may not matter. E.g. for studies examining relative
rates of word use and object interactions during a concentrated in-lab
exposure and test phase, denser talk in shorter recordings may be less
relevant. In contrast, research quantifying language input across
populations with varying demographic, social, and cultural properties
may need to be particularly sensitive to cross-sample comparison (cf.
Bergelson et al., under review; Cristia, Dupoux, Gurven, \& Stieglitz,
2017; Shneidman \& Goldin-Meadow, 2012).

\subsection{Object Presence}\label{object-presence}

Object presence was higher in videos than in audio-recordings. This may
be because the video-recordings truly had more object presence
(i.e.~infants mostly stayed in 1--2 rooms, interacting with what was at
hand). Alternatively, it may be the case that there are more ambiguous
cases of \enquote{object presence} in audio-recordings than
video-recordings, which may have contributed to \enquote{not present}
annotations at higher rates. Indeed, although object presence did
correlate significantly across recording-types (0.40), inter-rater
reliability was higher for videos than audio-recordings for this measure
(audio: 78.68\% agreement, Cohen's \(\kappa\)=0.57; video: 87.21\%
agreement, Cohen's \(\kappa\)=0.73). Our interpretation is that both
factors are likely at play, i.e.~that the object-presence difference we
find reflects a true difference between situations that arise during
daylong audio vs.~hour-long video-recordings, and that there is more
noise in the estimate of object-presence when visual information is
unavailable. Given that object presence and the related ideas of
referential transparency and contingent talk have been linked with early
language development (Bergelson \& Aslin, 2017; Cartmill et al., 2013;
McGillion, Pine, Herbert, \& Matthews, 2017; Yurovsky et al., 2013),
this property merits follow-up. A better understanding of situations and
contexts that elicit contingent, referentially-transparent caretaker
talk (around objects or otherwise) may be a fruitful avenue for further
work.

\subsection{Talker Variability}\label{talker-variability}

Infants heard nouns from more talkers per minute in videos than in
audio-recordings, though in raw numbers infants heard roughly double the
speakers over the course of a day as they heard in one video-recorded
hour (see Figure \ref{fig:gr-derived-counts-67-diff}). While we
considered noun input from all sources (human, electronic, etc.), the
quantity of talkers was largely swamped by input from mothers
(\textasciitilde{}65\%), which was also greater in videos than
audio-recordings. The proportion of input from fathers did not vary by
recording-type, though over half of videos did not include noun input
from fathers at all. This is largely due to sample demographics:
video-recording took place during weekday business hours, when the
fathers in this sample were largely at work. In contrast,
audio-recordings spanned work-hours and days of the week. Given that
fathers and mothers make different contributions to early language
development (Pancsofar \& Vernon-Feagans, 2006), this is a clear example
of a consequence of methodological choices: to better understand
parents' input, considering work-schedules is critical.

Talker variability is also relevant for recent in-lab studies: while
infants at the same age tested here looked equivalently to named images
when words were produced by a new person or their mother (Bergelson \&
Swingley, 2017), slightly older infants showed a word-learning advantage
when multiple talkers name new objects (Rost \& McMurray, 2010).
Furthermore, talker variability differentally influences certain
phonetic discriminations (Bergmann et al., 2016). Indeed, viable models
of phonetic learning must encorporate mechanisms specifying the role of
talker variability, even if only to show that a large range of talker
input converges on effectively equivalent phonetic categories. Better
approximations of infants' quotidian experiences are a prerequisite for
such models. The present results indicate that such estimates of talker
variability are inflated in hour-long videos relative to daylong
audio-recordings.

\subsection{Utterance-Types}\label{utterance-types}

We found more nouns in every utterance-type in videos than in
audio-recordings, per unit time. These utterance-types were a mix of
largely syntactic constructions (declaratives, questions, imperatives,
short phrases) and more situationally-defined utterance-types (reading,
singing). While its not particularly surprising that reading or singing
rates might vary across recording-types, we did not anticipate
differences in declaratives and questions, which made up most of the
input. Indeed, while questions and declaratives made up the majority of
the input for each recording-type, videos had relatively more questions
and fewer declaratives. This is key instance where methodological
choices may influence language acquisition theories: base-rates of
questions taken from videos would inflate estimates of auxiliary verbs
in the early input. Notably, previous work has found that studies vary
in whether they find links between questions (yes/no and wh-) in the
input and children's early productions, invoking developmental level to
explain cross-study differences (Barnes, Gutfreund, Satterly, \& Wells,
1983; cf. Huttenlocher, Vasilyeva, Cymerman, \& Levine, 2002). We add
the possibility that recording-type too may contribute to the base-rates
of questions in the input, even with age kept constant.

\subsection{Top Words}\label{top-words}

Our interpretation of these results is that relatively short
video-recordings overestimate young infants' typical noun input, and
that extrapolation based on daylong audio-recordings likely better
represents infants' daily lives. This underscores our third main
finding: the conclusions one would draw about which words are most
common in young infants' language input differ in their robustness
across families by recording-type. That is, the top audio words were all
heard by \(\geq75\%\) of these families; only one of the top 10 video
words (\enquote{hat}) was this common, and was clearly tied to the
recording equipment (see Figure \ref{fig:top10noun-freq}). This result
may be meaningful in several ways. First, corpora of child language
input offer our best proxies for what infants learn from: our
\enquote{top words} analysis suggests that the input would seem far more
heterogeneous across children based on hour-long video-recordings alone.
Second, word frequency and prevalence across families are often used to
select stimuli for in-lab study; relying on estimates from shorter, less
representative recordings may stymie the words studied in the lab. Thus,
understanding how cross-family noun-input stability scales with
recording-length may prove critical for future research; the word-level
results above are an initial exploration in understanding this dimension
of naturalistic observational data.

\subsection{Limitations and
Conclusions}\label{limitations-and-conclusions}

Given the technical limitation that currently available small
video-recorders have a shorter battery-life than audio-recorders, we
cannot conclusively separate the effects of modality and length. That
is, had we only audio-recorded for an hour or recorded video all day, we
may have obtained equivalent results across recording modalities.
Indeed, sub-sampling a single hour from each audio-recording would not
be an appropriate comparison to the videos, given that this hour would
either be constrained by time of day in a way the videos were not, or if
random, may contain features wholly different from the video recordings,
e.g.~naps or travel in the car, and the absence of researchers and
equipment bookending the session. More direct comparisons awaits
technological progress. A further limitation is self-selection into the
study: many parents are unwilling to invite researchers to record their
infants. Relatedly, our convenience sample does not reflect the broader
demographics of the US (let alone other cultures), and as such, should
be extended to other populations before conclusive generalizations about
sampling methodology can be made (cf. Bergelson et al., under review).

Understanding what infants learn from is a key part of understanding
what and how they learn at all. Here we have taken first steps in
understanding how two different data collection approaches may influence
our conclusions about early linguistic input. We find that even
naturalistic observer-free video-recordings appear to inflate language
input relative to daylong recordings, in ways that influence syntactic
constructions, word-specific experiences, talker-variability, and the
sheer quantity and diversity of nouns infants hear. Work from the
preceding decades suggests all of these factors matter for early
learning. Yet without knowing how sampling methods may hamper us in
principle, we necessarily limit our ability to adequately model infant
language acquisition. The present work charts datapoints within this
largely underspecified space, probing how robust linguistically-relevant
measures are across naturalistic sampling methods of infants' everyday
experiences.\newpage
