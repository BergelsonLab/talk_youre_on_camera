  \abstract{Measurements of infants' quotidian experiences provide critical
information about early development. However, the role of sampling
methods in providing this information is rarely examined. Here we
directly compare language input from hourlong videos and daylong
audio-recordings within the same group of 44 infants, at 6 and 7 months.
We find far denser noun input in video- than in audio-recordings, across
12 measures of language quantity and lexical diversity, talker
variability, utterance-type, and object presence. Although
audio-recordings captured \textasciitilde{}10x more awake-time than
videos, the noun input in them was only 2-4x greater. Most notably, per
unit time, videos featured more word-types and tokens, more questions
but fewer declaratives, and more talkers. In contrast,
\textgreater{}33\% of videos lacked certain noun input altogether,
e.g.~reading and fathers' speech. While we find moderate correlations
across recording-types, the most common audio-recording nouns were far
more consistant across families than top video-recording nouns. Thus,
hour-long videos and daylong audio-recordings provided fairly divergent
pictures of the input infants hear and learn from in their daily lives.
We suggest short video-recordings may inflate various language input
estimates, and should be used cautiously for extrapolation about common
words, talkers, utterance-types, and contexts at larger timescales. If
theories of language development are to be held accountable to `facts on
the ground' from observational data, greater care is needed to unpack
the ramifications of sampling methods of early language input.}

\section{Highlights}\label{highlights}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We measured 44 infants' early noun input during free-form,
  infant-caregiver interactions, in hour-long videos and daylong
  audio-recordings, at 6 and 7 months
\item
  Across measures of quantity, utterance-type, object presence, and
  talker, nouns-per-minute were 2-4 times more frequent in videos than
  in audio-recordings
\item
  Videos had relatively more questions and fewer declaratives. The most
  frequent nouns across audio-recordings also occured in most families;
  this was not true for videos.
\item
  Methodological differences in naturalistic observations techniques
  have great influence on researchers' potential conclusions about
  infants' language input
\end{itemize}

Researchers have studied development by observing infants experiencing
their natural habitats for over a century (Taine, 1876; Williams, 1937).
Over the past 20-30 years, written records have been increasingly
supplemented with annotated audio- and video-recordings, which have
described the linguistic, social, and physical landscape in which
infants learn. Such data --often shared through repositories like
CHILDES and Databrary-- in turn provide a proxy for various
\enquote{input} measures in theories of psycho-social, motor, and in
particular, linguistic development (MacWhinney, 2001).

Furthermore, recent technological advances have made it feasible to
collect longer, denser, and higher-quality recordings of infants'
day-to-day lives, which aim to provide better approximations of infants'
input and early language abilities (Bergelson \& Aslin, 2017; Oller et
al., 2010; B. C. Roy, Frank, DeCamp, Miller, \& Roy, 2015; VanDam et
al., 2016; Weisleder \& Fernald, 2013, \emph{inter alia}). Such
naturalistic data seeks to reveal what infants actually learn from as
they make use of their biological endowments and environmental
resources.

While cutting edge technologies make collecting observational data ever
easier, this growing toolbox increases researchers' decision load, with
serious but underexplored side-effects. For instance, researchers must
decide on recording modalities (e.g.~audio, video, both), where, whom,
and how long to record, and whether to capture structured or
free-ranging interactions, with or without experimenters present. While
any path through such decision-trees may lead to equivalent results,
this is rarely tested directly. Problematically, this leads to research
with theoretical conclusions built on equivalency assumptions that go
unmeasured.

In recent work directly comparing observational sampling methods;
Tamis-LeMonda, Kuchirko, Luo, Escobar, and Bornstein (2017) analyzed
mother-infant behavior in 5-minute structured interactions, and 45
minutes of free play. Home sessions were video-recorded by an
experimenter and transcribed. The results showed that relative to free
play, in structured interactions infants generally experienced more
language both in word-quantity (i.e.~tokens) and word-variability
(i.e.~types) per minute. They also found that language quantity across
contexts correlated, and that the peak five-minutes of the naturalistic
interaction was similar to the 5-minute structured interaction. They
conclude that sampling must be matched with research-question,
cautioning that while brief samples may be appropriate for studying
individual differences, extrapolations about overall language input from
short samples must be made with care.

In contrast, work by Hart and Risley (1995) extrapolated extensively.
Based on 30 hours of data per family (collected one hour per month for
2.5 years), these researchers estimated that by age four, children
receiving public assistance (n=6) heard \textgreater{}30-million fewer
words than professional-class children (n=13). While their results
highlighting SES differences certainly merited (and received) follow-up
(e.g. Fernald, Marchman, \& Weisleder, 2013; Noble, Norman, \& Farah,
2005, \emph{inter alia}), they have also been criticized as an extreme
over-extrapolation (Dudley-Marling \& Lucas, 2009; Michaels, 2013).

Still other research analyzes base rates of certain linguistic
phenomena, to provide in-principle proof of what young children can
learn from their input (Brent \& Siskind, 2001; Lidz, Waxman, \&
Freedman, 2003; Tomasello, 2000). Here, the research question generally
dictated what was deemed appropriate sampling. Problematically, for most
exploratory work, \enquote{appropriate} sampling is hard to premeditate.
For instance, practically any length of adult speech, across
wide-ranging recording parameters will find function words (e.g.
\enquote{of}) at much higher rates than content words (e.g.
\enquote{fork}). But for questions concerning many aspects of infants'
language input, it is largely unknown how methodological choices may
bias our answers.

In the present work, we explore these issues, directly comparing
hour-long video-recordings and daylong audio-recordings in a single
sample of 44 infants, at 6 and 7 months, as part of a larger study on
early noun learning. We annotated concrete nouns (generally, objects,
foods, animals, or body-parts) said to infants, or said loudly and
clearly in their presence. We further annotated three properties
previously linked with early language learning: (1) utterance-type,
which provides syntactic and situational information (Brent \& Siskind,
2001; DeBaryshe, 1993; Hoff \& Naigles, 2002) (2) object presence
(i.e.~referential transparency) which clarifies whether the referent of
a spoken word is visually appreciable (Bergelson \& Aslin, 2017;
Bergelson \& Swingley, 2013; Cartmill et al., 2013; Yurovsky, Smith, \&
Yu, 2013), and (3) talker, which lets us quantify the range of speakers
infants hear (Bergmann, Cristia, \& Dupoux, 2016; Rost \& McMurray,
2010).

This design sets up two overarching questions. First, do features of the
noun input in one video-recorded hour predict these same quantities in
an entire audio-recorded day? Second, do input quantities differ once
time is standardized? If the noun input is equivalent and predictive
across recording-types, then researchers can freely vary their
observational data collection approach with impunity. If it is not,
understanding the biases of various methods is critical to ensuring our
learning theories consider the data quantity and variability available
to learners day-to-day.

Thus, our main goal was to compare language input young infants receive
across four key properties (word quantity/diversity, utterance-type,
object presence, and talker), as measured by hourlong videos and
(separate) full-day audio-recordings. This seemingly methodological
question has deep implications for developmental theory: we examine how
sampling approaches may alter conclusions about the linguistic input
that in turn drives early development.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}

Participants were recruited from an existing database of families from
local hospitals, or who heard about the BabyLab from friends, family,
and outreach. Forty-six participants enrolled; two dropped out in the
early stages of the project leaving 44 infants in the final sample. All
infants were full-term (40 ± 3 weeks), had no known vision or hearing
problems, and heard \(\geq 75\%\) spoken English in the home.
Participants were 95\% white; 75\% of mothers had a B.A. or higher. The
families were enrolled in a yearlong study that included monthly audio-
and video-recordings, as well as in-lab visits every other month. Here
we report on the home recording data from the first two timepoints (6
and 7 months) of this study, for which participants were compensated
\$10.
\footnote{We include only these timepoints because no infants had begun producing words themselves (which changes the input for reasons orthogonal to those examined here); given the broader project aims, these timepoints alone had the entire daylong audio-recording annotated.}

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\subsection{Procedures}\label{procedures}

Participants gave consent at an initial lab visit for the larger study
through a process approved by the University of Rochester IRB.
Questionnaires about various aspects of the family's and infant's
background conducted during lab visits, not germane to the present
analysis, are reported elsewhere (Bergelson \& Aslin, 2017)
\textbf{FIX/ADD LAING\&BERGELSON REF; see last code-chunk}. Four
recordings were collected for each infant: an audio- and video-recording
at six and seven months, each on a different day. See Table
\ref{tab:recording-ages-table}.

Audio-video release forms were given to parents and collected after the
audio and video recordings for the month were complete. Parents could
opt to share the data with other authorized researchers and/or to have
excerpts used for academic presentation. The released audio and video
files can be accessed by registered researchers on Databrary.

\subsection{Video-Recordings}\label{video-recordings}

Researchers visited infants' homes each month to video-record a typical
hour of infants' lives from their own perspective. To achieve this,
infants were outfitted with a hat or headband affixed with two small,
lightweight Looxcie cameras (22g each). One camera was oriented slightly
down and the other slightly up, to capture most of the infant's visual
field (verified by Bluetooth with an iPad/iPhone during setup). A
standard camcorder (Panasonic HC-V100 or Sony HDR-CX240) on a tripod was
set up in a location that could best capture the infant. Parents were
asked to move this camera with them if they changed rooms. After set-up,
experimenters left for one hour.

\subsection{Audio-Recordings}\label{audio-recordings}

Audio-recordings captured a full day (up to 16 hours) of infants'
language input. Parents were given vests with a small chest-pocket, and
LENAs (LENA Foundation, Boulder, CO), small audio-recorders
(\textless{}60g) that fit into the vest pocket. Parents were asked to
put the vest and recorder on babies from when they awoke to when they
went to bed (with the exceptions of naps and baths). Parents were
permitted to pause the recorder at any time but were asked to keep such
pauses minimal.

\subsection{Data Processing}\label{data-processing}

Details of our entire data processing pipeline are on our lab wiki
(\url{https://osf.io/cxwyz/wiki/home/}). Videos were processed using
Sony Vegas and in-house video-editing scripts. Footage was aligned in a
single, multi-camera view before manual language annotation in Datavyu.
Audio recordings were initially processed by LENA proprietary software,
which segments and diarizes each audio file; this output was then
converted to CLAN format for further processing and manual annotation
(MacWhinney \& Wagner, 2010). Through in-house scripts, long periods of
silence were demarcated in these CLAN files (e.g.~when the audio vest
was removed or during naps). The CLAN files were then used for manual
language annotation.

\subsection{Language Annotation}\label{language-annotation}

Recordings were annotated by trained researchers. The \enquote{sparse
annotation} entailed marking each concrete noun heard by the child. This
included words directed to or easily overheard by the child (e.g.~words
directed at a sibling next to the infant), but not distant or background
language (e.g.~background television). We operationalized
\enquote{object words} as concrete, imageable nouns (e.g.~shoe, arm).
For each object word, we included the word (as said by the speaker, e.g.
\enquote{teethies}) and lemma (i.e.~dictionary form, e.g.
\enquote{tooth}), along with three properties: utterance-type, object
presence, and talker. Utterance-type classified each object word
utterance as declarative, question, imperative, reading, singing,
short-phrase, or unclear. Short-phrase utterances include words in
isolation and short, simple noun phrases (e.g. \enquote{the red ball} or
\enquote{kitty's paw}). Object-presence was a binary measure of whether
the object was present and attended to. Lastly, the word's talker was
recorded, including live interlocutors and electronics: mother, brother,
toy, etc.; talker classification was checked by a staff member with high
familiarity with each family. We assessed intercoder reliability on a
random contiguous 10\% of the annotations in each file for the two
categorical variables (utterance-type and object-presence). Reliability
was moderate to strong (utterance-type: 87\% agreement, Cohen's
\(\kappa\)=0.81; object-presence: 83\% agreement, Cohen's \(\kappa\)=
0.65).

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Analysis Plan}\label{analysis-plan}

Based on the coding scheme above, we derived 12 count measures from each
recordings' annotations for each child (n=44), recording-type (audio,
video), and month (six, seven). See Table \ref{tab:measures-tab}. We
then averaged the data from month six and seven to increase the
precision of our input estimates, and since we have no
theoretically-motivated reason to predict input differences across this
4 week span (i.e.~there are no developmental or linguistic milestones
typically achieved at 6-7 months.) We also normalized the count measures
by recording length; further details are below. While we initial
anticipated analyzing multi-level models with fixed effects of
recording-type and random subject-level effects, nearly all such models
revealed highly non-normal residuals (by visual inspection and Shapiro
Test), even when log-transformed; this limited interpretation across
measures. Thus, we instead report a simple set of nonparametric analyses
below. We used R for all data aggregation and analyses; the code that
rendered this manuscript and all its contents is available on github
here: \url{https://github.com/BergelsonLab/talk_youre_on_camera}.

For all recording-type comparisons, we look at whether our measures
\emph{differed} significantly (by two-tailed, paired Wilcoxon Test), and
\emph{correlated} significantly (by Kendall Rank Correlation) across the
given groups. This approach lets us compare, e.g., whether the
proportion of declaratives is indistinguishable in our audio and video
recordings independently of whether these values are correlated across
recording-types. We applied Holm's p-value adjustment for multiple
comparisons (\textbf{ADD REF:}Holm, 1979), for the set of 12 Wilcoxon
tests, and the set of 12 Kendall Correlations.

\subsection{Count Measures, Audio-
vs.~Video-recordings}\label{count-measures-audio--vs.video-recordings}

Before assessing how our 12 measures of noun input scaled between
hour-long video-recordings and daylong audio-recordings, we analyzed
recording lengths. Modally, videos were an hour (62 min, \emph{M}=60.79
min, SD=6.31, R=27.9-74.9 min), and audio-recordings were 16 hours (960
min, \emph{M}=858.41 min, SD=119.41, R=635-960 min), the maximum
capacity of the LENA device. While audio-recordings began when children
awoke, we further estimated the onsets and offsets of daytime naps by
removing the \enquote{silent} portions of the recordings (see Methods).
This provided an estimated upper-limit on infants' awake
(i.e.~non-silent) time (Mode = 654 min., \emph{M} = 603 min, SD=106.8,
R=385.2-951 min ). Our estimates comported with established norms for
6--8-month-olds in the US (\textbf{ADD REF:} Mandel et al, 2010), which
are 180 minutes of daytime sleep, and 600 minutes of nighttime sleep.
Infants were always awake during video recordings (save one infant, who
fell asleep before the recording-hour ended; that video was stopped at
sleep onset).

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics{sixseven_simplepapaja_files/figure-latex/gr-derived-counts-67-diff-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:gr-derived-counts-67-diff}Raw count of variables across
audio (indicated by solid borders) and video (dashed borders)
recordings. Variables, in order: object presence, nouns from mother and
father, utterance type, noun-types and tokens, and count of unique
speakers.}
\end{figure}

To examine how the hour-long video data \enquote{scale} to day-length
data descriptively, we first divided the 12 count metrics from the
videos by those from the audio-recordings for each child, to derive
\enquote{video-fraction} score. This showed that the video-recordings
were 0.07 of the length of audio-recordings, or 0.10 of the length if
only \enquote{non-silent} portions of the audio-recording are included.
However, rather than a concomitant 10-fold decrease in our count metrics
(as would be expected if the video captured a \enquote{representative}
hour of the day), the fractions averaged to 0.31 across measures; see
Table \ref{tab:normtable}. Thus, by and large, videos had a denser
concentration of nouns across our measures than did the audio
recordings. See Figure \ref{fig:gr-derived-counts-67-diff} for raw count
data for each metric.

We computed video-fractions (rather than the reciprocal,
i.e.~audio/video) because there were more zero values for videos than
audio-recordings (e.g.~instances when children did not hear any nouns
sung), rendering more undefined values. Indeed, \textgreater{}1/3 of
children did not hear nouns in reading or from fathers on videos in
either month. See Table \ref{tab:propna-missing-tables}.

\begin{table}[tbp]

\end{threeparttable}
\end{center}
\end{table}

We next normed our count values by the number of minutes in each. For
example, if an infant heard 500 noun-tokens in 800 minutes of non-silent
audio-recording, and 200 in 60 minutes of videos, this was normed to .62
and 3.3 noun-tokens per minute, respectively. Zero values are retained
within the normed count data.
\footnote{One infant's zero value was excluded from 'father' measures because this infant had no father.}

With the normed data, 11/12 metrics occured at significantly lower rates
in audio recordings than video recordings (all
adjusted-p\textless{}.05). The remaining metric, number of nouns from
fathers, was statistically indistinguishable across recording types
(adjusted-p\textgreater{}.05). Thus, overall, per unit time, infants
heard less noun input across our metrics of quantity, talker,
utterance-type and object presence in audio recordings than in videos.
We provide both raw and normed count data in Figure
\ref{fig:gr-derived-counts-67-diff} and
\ref{fig:gr-derived-normcounts-diff}.

Looking next at correlations, we find that 10/12 metrics correlated in
audio vs.~video data; nouns per minute heard from fathers and in singing
did not. The size of the correlations (i.e.~Kendall's \(\tau\)) was
moderate (excluding the two non-significant metrics, \emph{M} = 0.44,
0.27 - 0.57, all adjusted-p\textless{}.05). See Table
\ref{tab:normtable} and Figure \ref{fig:gr-derived-normcounts-corr}.

\subsection{Exploratory Analyses over Utterance-Types and
Nouns}\label{exploratory-analyses-over-utterance-types-and-nouns}

Lastly, we undertook two sets of highly exploratory analyses, at the
utterance level, and at the word level. The utterance-type analysis is
based on the unanticipated observation that while declaratives and
questions made up \textgreater{}2/3 of the input for each
recording-type, the videos appeared to contain relatively more questions
and fewer declaratives (See Fig \ref{fig:gr-derived-counts-67-diff} and
Fig \ref{fig:gr-derived-normcounts-diff}). To test this statistically,
we converted the six utterance-type counts to proportions (e.g.~number
of nouns heard in declaratives over total noun tokens) for each
recording-type. Wilcoxon tests of each utterance type in audio-
vs.~video-recording (corrected for multiple comparisons as before)
revealed that indeed, declaratives and questions occured at different
rates in video and audio recordings (both adjusted-p\textless{}.05),
with audio-recordings containing relatively fewer questions
(\(M_{video}\)=0.26, \(M_{audio}\)=0.19) and more declaratives than
videos (\(M_{video}\)=0.40, \(M_{audio}\)=0.50). No other proportional
utterance-type differences reached significance across recording-types
(all adjusted-p\textgreater{}.05). See Figure
\ref{fig:gr-ut-count-collapsed}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics{sixseven_simplepapaja_files/figure-latex/gr-ut-count-collapsed-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:gr-ut-count-collapsed}Utterance type proportions across
audio (indicated by solid borders) and video (dashed borders)
recordings. Proportions were calculated as the number of each noun types
over total noun tokens.}
\end{figure}

Our final analysis is at the word level; we aim to provide a first-pass
characterization of whether audio and video recordings captured the same
nouns and the same relative frequencies across words and families. The
distribution of nouns in our recordings was zipfian: of the 5801 unique
object words (3137 lemmas) heard across months and recording types, only
2482 (960 lemmas) were heard more than once.

\caption{\label{fig:top-100-logspace}Log-scaled counts of the top 100 words
in audio and video recordings. Each node represents the averaged count,
across all participants in both months, of an unique noun-token. Words
that occured zero times in one recording-type are not shown.}
\end{figure}

We examined the top 100 most frequent nouns from audio- and
video-recordings (n=136 due to ties, n=68 without words that occurred
zero times in one recording-type). Frequency across recording-types
correlated significantly (Kendall's tau: 0.39, p\textless{}.0001) even
with zero-frequency words included (Kendall's tau: 0.25,
p\textless{}.0001; see Figure \ref{fig:top100-corr-rectype} and
\ref{fig:top-100-logspace}).

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics{sixseven_simplepapaja_files/figure-latex/top100-corr-rectype-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:top100-corr-rectype}Correlations of the top 100 words in
audio vs.~video recordings. Each node represents the count of a unique
word that occurred in both audio and video recordings, averaged across
all participants in both months.}
\end{figure}

Finally, looking at just the top ten words by recording-type, we find
several notable results. Firstly, four of the top ten words in each
recording-type overlapped (baby, book, mouth, toes), suggesting that
extremely common words are relatively conserved across recording-types.
However, the top audio words were far more common across families (see
Figure \ref{fig:top10noun-freq}). Indeed, the ten most frequent nouns in
audio-recordings were heard by 37-44 (\emph{M} = 42.30 (2.63)) of the 44
families, while those in video-recordings were heard by 23-42 (\emph{M}
= 31 (6.27). Finally, the top audio words were \textasciitilde{}3x as
common as the top video words (\(M_{audio}\)=761.80(114.75),
\(M_{video}\)=232.80(91.38)), again underscoring the higher density of
nouns in video recordings (which were 1/10 the lenth of audio recordings
on average). Taken together, this exploratory analysis suggests that
daylong audio-recordings may render more stable estimates of pervasively
common words across families than do video-recordings.

Each node represents the frequency count of a top audio or video word over both months (x axis) and count of participants who were exposed to the word in either or both months (y axis).}\label{fig:top10noun-freq}
\end{figure}

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

Our results can be distilled to three key findings. First, infants heard
relatively more nouns in the video recordings than in the audio
recordings. Per minute, infants heard \textasciitilde{}2-4x more noun
input across our quantity, speaker, utterance-type, and object-presence
metrics when they and their caretakers were video-recorded for an hour
versus audio-recorded for a day. Second, while our metrics genearlly
correlated across audio- and video-recordings, the relative rates of the
most prevalent utterance types, and the rates of unattested data for
certain metrics varied across them. Finally, while the highest frequency
words across recording types largely overlapped and correlated (and
exhibited Zipfian frequency distributions), top words from the daylong
audio-recording appear to better represent the noun input across
families.

\subsection{Noun Quantity and Lexical
Diversity}\label{noun-quantity-and-lexical-diversity}

The pattern across recording-types suggests to us that parents behaved
naturally during recordings, but that \enquote{natural} behavior
differed by recording context. This is consistent with a point made by
Suskind et al \textbf{ADD REF}(2013) regarding an intervention:
\enquote{sustaining increased talk for a 10-hr recording day is much
less likely than being on best behavior during {[}a{]} 1-hr videotaped
session\ldots{}} While their work aimed to encourage caretakers to talk
more, the point stands for our goals of observing infants' typical
input. We add to their suggestion that shorter video-recording itself
may elicit certain kinds of interactions, separate from deliberate
intent or lack thereof on caretakers' part.

Indeed, the kinds of everyday interactions we captured in daylong audio
recordings (family members rushing to get out the door or get meals on
the table, sibling quibbles, etc.) tended to \enquote{feel} more
natural. Families likely simply found it easier to go about their day
freely with infants in a special vest than with a camera on their head,
and a camcorder in the corner. Lending some support that equipment
prominence matters, both \enquote{hat} and \enquote{camera} are in the
top 10 words from video-recordings each month; no analogous nouns
(e.g.~vest, recorder) topped the frequency rankings in our audio
recordings (see Figures \ref{fig:top10noun-freq} and
\ref{fig:top-100-logspace}).

Our comparison across recording-types highlighted many differences
across our noun input measures, even with family and age held constant.
The quantity metrics result provide a conceptual replication and
extension of Tamis-Lemonda et al. (2017). Despite numerous
methodological differences (length and type of recordings compared,
experimenter presence, infant age, word class analyzed), both studies
found that parent talk per unit time was significantly higher in shorter
recordings. While the difference they find is less extreme numerical
(roughly 1.5-2x the number of types and tokens in the longer vs.~shorter
recording compared to our 2-3-fold difference), this general pattern
appears robust across our very different sampling methods. Taken
together, these results converge in suggesting that shorter recordings
elicit denser caregiver talk.

For certain research questions, these differences in volubility and
lexical diversity may not matter. For instance, for studies aiming to
compare relative rates of word use and object interactions during a
concentrated exposure and test phase in the lab, higher volubility and
lexical diversity in shorter recordings may be less relevant. In
contrast, research aiming to quantify language input across populations
with varying demographic, social, and cultural properties may need to be
particular sensitive to cross-sample camparison in word quantity, as a
function of sampling parameters (cf Bergelson et al, under review;
Cristia et al, 2017 CHIDev, Schneidman \& Goldin-Meadow, 2012).
\textbf{ADD REFS}

\subsection{Object Presence}\label{object-presence}

We also found more object presence in videos than in audio-recordings.
This may be because the video recordings truly had more object presence
(i.e.~infants mostly stayed in 1-2 rooms, interacting with caregivers
and objects at hand). Alternatively, it may be the case that there are
more ambiguous cases of \enquote{object presence} in audio recordings
than video recordings, which may have contributed to \enquote{not
present} annotations at higher rates. Indeed, although object presence
did correlate significantly across recording-types (0.40 inter-rater
reliability was higher for videos than audio-recordings for this measure
(audio: 78.68\% agreement, Cohen's \(\kappa\)=0.57; video: 87.21\%
agreement, Cohen's \(\kappa\)=0.73). Our interpretation is that both
factors are likely at play, i.e.~that the object-presence difference we
find reflects a true difference between situations that arise during
daylong-audio vs.~hourlong-video recordings, and that there is more
noise in the estimate of object-presence when visual information is
unavailable. Given that object presence and the related ideas of
referential transparency and contingent talk have been linked with early
word learning and language development \textbf{ADD REFS}(Bergelson \&
Aslin, 2017; Yurovsky et al 2012; McGillion et al, 2017;
Cartmill..Trueswell, 2013), this property in particular merits followup.
That is, a more thorough understanding of the situations and contexts
that elicit and promote contingent, referentially-transparent caretaker
talk (around objects or otherwise) may be a fruitful avenue for further
work.

\subsection{Talker Variability}\label{talker-variability}

Our talker-based results also revealed that infants heard nouns from
more talkers per minute in videos than in audio-recordings, though in
raw numbers infants heard roughly double the speakers over the course of
a day as they heard in one video-recorded hour (see Figure
\ref{fig:gr-derived-count-67-diff}. While we considered noun input from
all sources (human, electronic, etc.), the quantity of talkers was
largely swamped by the preponderance of the input
(\textasciitilde{}65\%) that came from infants' mothers; this quantity
too was greater in videos than audio-recordings. Input from fathers did
not vary by recording-type, though over half of videos did not include
noun input from fathers at all. This is largely due to the demographics
of our sample: we video-recorded during regular business hours during
weekdays, a time when the fathers in our sample were largely at work. In
contrast, audiorecordings could happen on any day of the week, at
parents' leisure. Given that fathers and mothers make different
contributions to early language development (Pancsofar \&
Vernon-Feagans, 2006), this is a clear example of a consequence of
methodological choices: to better understand the role of input from
fathers, it is critical to sample with work-schedules in mind.

Questions concerning talker variability in the input are also relevant
for recent in-lab studies: while infants at the same age tested here
looked equivalently to a named target image when words were produced by
a new person or their mother (Bergelson \& Swingley, 2017), slightly
older infants show a word-learning advantage when they heard multiple
talkers naming new objects (Rost \& McMurray, 2010). Other recent work
has highlighted that certain phonetic discriminations are differentially
affected when talker variability is considered (Bergmann et al., 2016).
One general goal in such research is to test the proposed mechanisms by
which infants generalize over or utilize talker variability during early
learning. To this end, benchmarking how much talker variability is in
infants' quotidian experience is desirable, even if only to say that a
given model is unaltered by deviations within a given range). The
present results find that these estimates are inflated in hourlong
video-recordings relative to daylong audio-recordings.

\subsection{Utterance-Types}\label{utterance-types}

Turning to our utterance-type metrics, there too we found more nouns in
every utterance-type in videos than in audio-recordings, per unit time.
The utterance-types we annotated were a mix of largely syntactic
constructions (declaratives, questions, imperatives, short phrases), and
more situationally-defined utterance-types (reading,
singing).\footnote{When necessary, we used prosody to disambiguate, e.g. "Get your blocks?" was coded as a question}
While its not particularly surprising that rates of e.g.~reading or
singing might vary across recording-types, we did not anticipate
differences in relative rates of declaratives and questions, i.e.~the
utterance types that made up most of the input. We found that while
questions and declaratives made up the majority of the input for each
recording-type at each month, videos had relatively more questions and
fewer declaratives. This is key example of methodological choices
potentially influencing language acquisition theories: base rates of
interrogatives taken from videos would inflate estimates of auxiliary
verbs in the early input. Indeed, previous work has noted that published
studies vary in whether they find links between questions (yes/no and
wh-) in the input, and children's early productions, with developmental
level of the child invoked to explain differences across studies (Barnes
et al, 1983; see discussion in Huttenlocher et al, 2002) \textbf{add
refs}. Here we add the possibility that recording-type too may
contribute to the base-rates of questions in the input, even with age
kept constant.

The reading data too highlight interesting differences across
recording-types. Twice as many infants were not read to in videos,
compared to audio-recordings (see Table
\ref{tab:propna-missing-tables}). Yet, there were still significantly
more nouns-per-minute heard in reading in videos, and nouns in reading
across recording-types also correlated significantly. This pattern
highlights the differences in answers about \enquote{reading in the
input} that can be garnered by even slightly different formulations of
the relevant question. Given the clear benefits in input richness and
language abilities linked to reading in infancy found in previous
research (DeBaryshe, 1993; Montag, Jones, \& Smith, 2015), and the
likelihood that reading occurs at higher rates at certain parts of the
day (a research question in its own right!), we suggest here too that
considering reading input on the daylong scale may give a more accurate
picture of its presence in infants' lives.

\subsection{Top Words}\label{top-words}

Our interpretation of the present results is that findings based on
relatively short video-recordings overestimate young infants' typical
noun input, and that extrapolation based on daylong audio recordings
likely better represents infants' daily lives. This underscores our
third main finding: that the conclusions one would draw about which
words are most common in young infants' language input differed in their
robustness across families by recording-type. That is, the top audio
words were all heard by \(\geq 75\%\) of the families we recorded; only
one of the top 10 video words (\enquote{hat}) was this common across
families, and was a clear artifact of our hat-mounted video-cameras.
This result may be meaningful in several ways. From a high level
viewpoint, corpora of child language input offer our best proxies for
what infants learn from: our \enquote{top words} analysis suggests that
one would be led to believe that the input is far more heterogenous
across children than it really is based on hourlong video-recordings
alone. At a lower level, word frequency and prevalence across families
are often used to select stimuli for in-lab study; relying on estimates
from shorter, less representative recordings may stymie the words we
chose to study in the lab. Thus, understanding how cross-family
noun-input stability scales with recording-length may prove critical for
future research; the word-level results above are an initial exploration
in understanding this dimension of naturalistic observational data.

\subsection{Limitations and
Conclusions}\label{limitations-and-conclusions}

Given the technical limitation that currently-available infant-friendly
video-recorders have a shorter battery life than audio-recorders, we
cannot conclusively separate the effects of modality and length. That
is, had we only audio-recorded for an hour, or recorded video all day,
we may have obtained equivalent results across recording modalities.
Such a comparison awaits technological progress. A further limitation is
the likely influence of self-selection into the study: many parents are
unwilling to invite researchers to record their infants' interactions.
Relatedly, our convenience sample does not reflect the broader
demographics of the US (let alone other cultures or populations), and as
such this work merits extension to other populations before conclusive
generalizations about sampling methodology can be made (cf
{\textbf{???}}) \textbf{FIX/ADD BERGELSON\_ETAL REF; see last
code-chunk}.

Understanding what infants learn from is a key part in understanding
what and how they learn at all. Here we have taken first steps in
understanding how two different data collection approaches may influence
our conclusions about early linguistic input. We find that even
naturalistic observer-free video-recordings appear to inflate language
input, relative to daylong recordings, in ways that influence syntactic
constructions, word-specific experiences, talker-variability, and the
sheer quantity and diversity of nouns infants hear. Work from the
preceding decades suggests all of these factors matter for early
learning. Yet, without knowing how our sampling methods may be limiting
us in principle, we necessarily limit our ability to adequately model
infant language acquisition. The present work charted datapoints within
this largely underspecified space, probing how robust
linguistically-relevant measures are across two naturalistic sampling
methods of infants' everyday experiences.
